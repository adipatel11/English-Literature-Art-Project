# English-Literature-Art-Project
A project for my English Literature class in which we had to create a creative representation of a work discussed upon during the first semester.


## Background Information:
At my high school, my University English Literature instructor assigned a multimodal art project for us to do. The point of this project
is the apply the creative sides of our brains to one of the works (poems and short stories) that we discussed in class this year. I chose
to make a game based on John Donne's "The Flea". My game reflects the moment in the poem in which the speaker discourages his wife from killing
the flea when shortly after she does it anyways.

## Instructions:

### 1. Run the main python file with the images folder in the same directory
### 2. Click on buttons to interact
### 3. Use Arrow Keys to move the Flea

*Note: The hand increases speed as the user gains more points
